            <h1>Q & A</h1>
            <h4>Q. You entered the university in 2014, why are you still there?</h4>
            <p>A. I took a three years break to finish my required military service to the Republic of Korea Army.</p>
            <h4>Q. I thought you had to serve for only 21 months?</h4>
            <p>A. I had a difficulty finding a position in the Army because I was in the 'baby boomer' generation
                of South Korea which resulted in narrower openings. Also, I needed time to get all
                the necessary documents for the application when I went back to Korea because I was not able to
                do so in the U.S. As a result, it almost took me half a year to find the position which enlongated
                the break.
            </p>
            <h4>Q. Ok, so what did you in between?</h4>
            <p>A. I worked part time jobs at a cinema and a bar. I would like to say I did it to get some valuable
                life experiences and I actually did, but the purpose back then was to get some extra cash 
                to spend before the military service. After the service, I worked as an assistant for a small 
                company in my hometown for about half a year.
            </p>
            <h4>Q. Why? Couldn't you have returned to school?</h4>
            <p>A. I could, but I was not sure about what to do with my life back then so I hesitated coming back to the U.S.</p>
            <h4>Q. Still the numbers don't add up. Then you should have had returned to school in 2018 and 
                graduated in 2020.
            </h4>
            <p>A. The reason why I hesitated coming back to the U.S. was related to the answer for this question. 
                It is embarassing to say this, but I failed most of the classes in my freshmen year and
                as a result, I was dropped out of the university. In order to be readmitted, I had to take
                classes from another institution with good grades as an evidence for an improvement, so I 
                attended the community college nearby the university (Parkland College) from Spring 2018 even though
                I came back to the U.S. in Summer 2018 (I took online classes while working). Thankfully, I was
                able to get good grades at there (I got straight A's) and I got readmitted in Summer 2019.
            </p>
            <h4>Q. What had been different? Why did you fail in freshmen year but did well in community college?</h4>
            <p>A. The major difference was that I was diagnosed with ADHD and depression for the first time in my
                life while I was attending the community college. I always knew that I was not having the best
                mental health but diagnosed with and treated for such conditions had more impact than I thought.
                Plus, the classes from the community college were easier than the equivalents from the university.
            </p>
            <h4>Q. How is your grade after the readmission? It must be better than before.</h4>
            <p>A. It is! The list of the technical courses that I took after the readmission and the grades are following:</p>

            <h4>Q. Enough about the academics. Why don't you have any experience then?</h4>
            <p>A. As you can see from the list above, I took the introductory programming class after
                the readmission because the community college that I attended did not provide an equivalent class. 
                As a result, now that I think of it, I could have applied for some internships with 
                the knowledges I got back then, but I did not because I was not confident about my skills.
            </p>
            <h4>Q. Why would I (my company) hire you? You got subpar grades and no experience.</h4>
            <p>A. I agree with you but I think I have some qualities that other applicants might not have.
                Having gone through several turmoils in my life accompanied by some ups and
                extreme downs, I was able to find out that the life did not depend on the ups and downs but
                the attitude I had when I faced them. I was able to figure out that I was the only one
                who could drag myself out of the holes created by my wrongful decisions and 
                staying in the holes doing nothing but complaining would not change anything.
                I know that "dragging myself out" takes a hard and honest work while complying with the
                rules set by the groups that I belong to. Even though I do not have any experience in tech industry,
                I met and had worked with a broad spectrum of people in different industries. 
                In short, I would say that I am a bit mature kid who would get the same salary as the younger kids.
