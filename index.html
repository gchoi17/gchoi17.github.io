            <h1>Q & A</h1>
            <div clss="row">
                <h3>Q. You entered the university in 2014, why are you still there?</h3>
                <p>I took three years break to finish my required military service to the Korean Army</p>
                <h3>Q. I thought you had to serve for only 21 months?</h3>
                <p>I had a difficulty finding a position in the Army because I was in the 'baby boomer' generation
                    of South Korea which resulted in narrower openings. Also, I needed time to get all
                    the necessary documents for the application when I went back to Korea because I was not able to
                    do so in the U.S. As a result, it almost took me half a year to find the position which enlongated
                    the break.
                </p>
                <h3>Q. Ok, so what did you in between?</h3>
                <p>I worked part time jobs at a cinema and a pub. I would like to say I did it to get some valuable
                    life experiences and I actually did, the purpose back then was to get some extra cash 
                    to spend before the military service. After the service, I worked as an assistant for a small 
                    company in my hometown for about half a year.
                </p>
                <h3>Q. Why? Couldn't you have returned to school?</h3>
                <p>I could, but I was not sure about what to do back then so I hesitated coming back to the U.S.</p>
                <h3>Ok, but still the numbers don't count up. Then you should have returned to school in 2018 and 
                    graduated in 2020.
                </h3>
                <p>The reason why I hesitated coming back to the U.S. was related to the answer for this question. 
                    It is embarassing to say this, but I failed most of the classes I took in my freshmen year and
                    as a result, I was dropped out of the university. In order to be readmitted, I had to take
                    classes from the other institution with good grades as an evidence for the improvement, so I 
                    attended a community college nearby the university (Parkland College) from Spring 2018 even though
                    I came back to the U.S. in Summer 2018 (I took online classes while working). Thankfully, I was
                    able to get good grades at there (3.76 out of 4.0) and I got readmitted in Summer 2019.
                </p>
                <h3>Q. What had been different? Why did you fail in freshmen year but did well in community college?</h3>
                <p>The major difference was that I was diagnosed with ADHD and depression for the first time in my
                    life while I was attending the community college. I always knew that I was not having the best
                    mental health but diagnosed with and treated for such conditions had more impact than I thought.
                    Plus, the classes from the community college were easier than the equivalents from the university.
                </p>
                <h3>Q. How is your grade after the readmission? It must be better than before.</h3>
                <p>It is! The list of the technical courses that I took after the readmission and the grades are below</p>
