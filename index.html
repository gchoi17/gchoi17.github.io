            <h1>Q & A</h1>
            <h5>Q. You entered the university in 2014, why are you still there?</h5>
            <p>A. I took a three years break to fulfill my required military service to the Republic of Korea Army.</p>
            <h5>Q. I thought you had to serve for 21 months?</h5>
            <p>A. I had a difficulty finding a position in the Army because I was in the "baby boomer" generation
                in South Korea and it brought unexpected competitions to enlist. As a result, it almost took me half a year
                to find an opening which enlongated the duration of the break.
            </p>
            <h5>Q. What did you in between?</h5>
            <p>A. I worked part time jobs at a cinema and a bar. After discharged, I worked as an assistant for a
                 small company in my hometown for about half a year.
            </p>
            <h5>Q. Couldn't you have returned to school?</h5>
            <p>A. I could, but I was not sure about what to do with my life back then so I hesitated coming back to the U.S.</p>
            <h5>Q. Still the numbers don't add up.</h5>
            <p>A. I failed most of the classes in my freshmen year and consequently, I was dropped out of the university. 
                In order to be readmitted, I had to take classes from another institution with good grades as an evidence 
                for an improvement, so I attended the community college nearby the university (Parkland College) from Spring 2018 and
                I came back to the U.S. in Summer 2018. I ended up getting good grades (straight A's) and I got readmitted in Summer 2019.
            </p>
            <h5>Q. What had been different from your freshmen year?</h5>
            <p>A. I was diagnosed with and treated for ADHD and depression while I was attending the community college and 
                it brought a noticeable improvement on my academic performance. Plus, the classes from the community college were easier than the equivalents from the university.
            </p>
            <h5>Q. How is your grade after the readmission?</h5>
            <p>A. The list of the technical courses I took after the readmission and the grades are following:</p>

            <h5>Q. Why don't you have any experience?</h5>
            <p>A. I had to take the introductory programming class after
                the readmission because the community college did not provide an equivalent class. 
                I could have applied for some internships, but I decided not to because I was not confident about my skills back then.
                I will be starting my first work experience as a teaching assistant next semester.
            </p>
            <h5>Q. Why would my company hire you?</h5>
            <p>A. I have qualities that other applicants might not have. I went through serious struggles
                in my life and figured out that my life depended more on the attitude I had than the actual ups
                and downs. I found out I must be the one to drag myself out of the pitfalls created by my 
                wrong decisions. I met and worked with a broad spectrum of people in different industries and 
                I believe it helped me to grow as a person. In short, I'm willing to work as hard as I can to improve
                myself as a professional and contribute to your company while doing so.
