            <h1>Q & A</h1>
            <div clss="row">
                <h4>Q. You entered the university in 2014, why are you still there?</h4>
                <p>I took three years break to finish my required military service to the Korean Army</p>
                <h4>Q. I thought you had to serve for only 21 months?</h4>
                <p>I had a difficulty finding a position in the Army because I was in the 'baby boomer' generation
                    of South Korea which resulted in narrower openings. Also, I needed time to get all
                    the necessary documents for the application when I went back to Korea because I was not able to
                    do so in the U.S. As a result, it almost took me half a year to find the position which enlongated
                    the break.
                </p>
                <h4>Q. Ok, so what did you in between?</h4>
                <p>I worked part time jobs at a cinema and a pub. I would like to say I did it to get some valuable
                    life experiences and I actually did, but the purpose back then was to get some extra cash 
                    to spend before the military service. After the service, I worked as an assistant for a small 
                    company in my hometown for about half a year.
                </p>
                <h4>Q. Why? Couldn't you have returned to school?</h4>
                <p>I could, but I was not sure about what to do back then so I hesitated coming back to the U.S.</p>
                <h4>Q. Ok, but still the numbers don't count up. Then you should have returned to school in 2018 and 
                    graduated in 2020.
                </h4>
                <p>The reason why I hesitated coming back to the U.S. was related to the answer for this question. 
                    It is embarassing to say this, but I failed most of the classes I took in my freshmen year and
                    as a result, I was dropped out of the university. In order to be readmitted, I had to take
                    classes from the other institution with good grades as an evidence for the improvement, so I 
                    attended a community college nearby the university (Parkland College) from Spring 2018 even though
                    I came back to the U.S. in Summer 2018 (I took online classes while working). Thankfully, I was
                    able to get good grades at there (3.76 out of 4.0) and I got readmitted in Summer 2019.
                </p>
                <h4>Q. What had been different? Why did you fail in freshmen year but did well in community college?</h4>
                <p>The major difference was that I was diagnosed with ADHD and depression for the first time in my
                    life while I was attending the community college. I always knew that I was not having the best
                    mental health but diagnosed with and treated for such conditions had more impact than I thought.
                    Plus, the classes from the community college were easier than the equivalents from the university.
                </p>
                <h4>Q. How is your grade after the readmission? It must be better than before.</h4>
                <p>It is! The list of the technical courses that I took after the readmission and the grades are below</p>

                <p>Considering I would have got A's for both classes that changed to CR/NC
                    because of the pandemic, I got two A+'s', four A's, one A-, three B's and one C+ for the
                    technical courses I took after the readmission.
                </p>
                <h4>Q. Enough about the academics. Why don't you have any experience then?</h4>
                <p>As you can see from the list above, I took the introductory programming class after
                    the readmission because the community college that I attended did not provide an equivalent class. 
                    As a result, now that I think of it, I could have applied for some internships with 
                    the knowledges that I got back then, but I did not because I was not confident about my skills.
                </p>
                <h4>Q. Why would I (my company) hire you? You got subpar grades and no experience.</h4>
                <p>I agree with you but I think I have some qualities that other applicants might not have.
                    Having gone through several turmoils in my life that accompanied with some ups and
                    extreme downs, I was able to find out that the life did not depend on the ups and downs but
                    the attitude that I took when I faced them. I was able to figure out that I was the only one
                    who can drag myself out of the holes created by the wrongful life decisions that I made and 
                    staying in the holes doing nothing but complaining about my life would not help with anything.
                    In short, I would say that I am an old kid who would get the same salary as the young kids.
